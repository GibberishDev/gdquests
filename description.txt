Quests API

Allows mod authors to add quests with different completion conditions (amoung those are but not limited to: mob kills, boss kills, item pickups, time, health/mana/defence/[other stat] value, crafted item, biome visited. All conditions and other useful stuff can be found at [TODO: remember to paste here github link]) that can be mixed and matched for perfect condition for a sophisticated quest. Completed quest also can be accesed by other mods for giving a reward to a player. Quest window can be pulled up by book, inventory button or even keybind. Some might say that system looks a lot like Minecraft's advancement system and yes, it is.
